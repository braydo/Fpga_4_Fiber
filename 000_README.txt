.			Here can be run simulations with MODELSIM (see z_README.txt). TestBench.v is the simulation top level
|			DdrSdramIf_phy_alt_mem_phy_pll.mif is needed by ModelSim (copied from DdrSdramIf)
|
+---+-- Mpd_Common	Common Rtl Code for both devices, user generated and MegaWizard generated
    |
    +-- mpd_fiber	Aurora Interface SSP compatible (in VHDL, written by Ben Raydo)
