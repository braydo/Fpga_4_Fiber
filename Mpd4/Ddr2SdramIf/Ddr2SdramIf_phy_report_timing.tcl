# The resynchronization timing analysis concerns transferring read data that
# has been captured with a DQS strobe to a clock domain under the control of
# the ALTMEMPHY. We use a dedicated PLL phase that is calibrated by the
# sequencer, and tracks any movements in the data valid window of the captured
# data. This means that the exact length of the DQS and CK traces don't affect
# the timing analysis, and the calibration will remove any static offset from
# the rest of the path too. With static offset removed, the remaining
# uncertainties with be limited to VT variation, jitter and skew (since one
# clock phase is chosen for the whole interface).
# 
# The implementation of this timing analysis is a little more involved, since
# there is no way to express a skew constraint in SDC scripts. We need to first
# of all make the fitter place the resync registers such that they have a low
# skew between them, and then make sure the timing is checked during sign off.
# Although the requirement is that this bus is low skew and it would be
# possible to route it all the way across the chip as long as all bits were the
# same length, in practice the best way to get a low skew is to place all the
# resync registers as close as possible to the IOE.
# We force the fitter to place the registers as close as possible by applying
# an unachievable timing constraint on them. Because of the nature of the
# fitter's algorithms, this will not harm fitting elsewhere in the chip. The
# timing sign off however needs to have a different set of constraints, since
# there would otherwise be a set of failing paths in the design. It would be
# possible to simply cut the path, but that would have the effect of making the
# paths disappear altogether. We need to be able to find out how long they are
# to measure the skew, so the solution is to replace the unachievable
# constraint with a very loose one.
# 
# Since we don't have a proper constraint for sign off the ALTMEMPHY needs to
# provide its own analysis of this path. The code is generated in <variation_name>_report_timing.tcl,
# and this file is registered to be run automatically from the 'report DDR'
# button in TimeQuest's GUI, or alternatively by simply running:
# 
# source <variation_name>_report_timing.tcl
# 
# This does however mean that these paths are not checked by simply running a
# report of the worst case failing paths.

# The DQS strobe is used as a clock to capture the incoming data, but it is not
# a true clock since the DQS line will go tri-state at the end of a read burst.
# In order to prevent the read data from being corrupted by noise on the DQS
# strobe at the end of a read burst the DQS line is pulled low by special
# purpose postamble protection logic in the DQS block. This logic is held in
# reset until just before the final falling edge of DQS. Once the final edge of
# DQS arrives the logic is activated and the DQS strobe is disabled. The
# important postamble timing path goes to the register that is clocked by the
# falling edge of DQS.
# 
# The series of events during operation of the postamble block are as follows:
#  * The doing-a-read-burst signal is high, and the postamble enable register
# (bottom left) is held in preset
#  * The penultimate falling DQS edge happens. The postamble enable register is
# unaffected, since it is in preset
#  * The preset signal is released
#  * The final falling edge of the DQS burst happens, and the postamble enable
# register is clocked
#  * The input to the enable register is tied to ground, and so the and-gate
# disables the DQS clock.
# The control signal for the postamble is not calibrated specifically. It is
# driven from the inverted resync clock, which is calibrated for the purposes
# of resync only.
# 
# The output of the postamble control register must reach the postamble enable
# register before the last falling edge of DQS in order that the postamble
# protection logic is triggered. This puts a constraint on the sum of the delay
# from the DDIO to resync registers plus the delay from the postamble control
# register to the DQS DDIO.
# There is also a constraint that the postamble control must be released after
# the penultimate falling edge of DQS. Since the DQS clock and the resync clock
# are nominally aligned, there is a possibility of hold timing race conditions.
# In practice this is rarely an issue, since the delay getting into and out of
# the IOE is significant.
# 
# The timing analysis for postamble requires us to use the fact that the resync
# path has been set up by the sequencer. The postamble path needs to be
# statically analyzed, since it is not dynamically calibrated like resync.
# 
# The postamble control register is driven by the resync clock, and we know
# that the clock phase will be shifted by the sequencer to balance the resync
# setup and hold margins.
# 
# Let's assume for a moment that we guessed a resync phase during compilation
# that was exactly the same setting that the dynamic sequencer would pick after
# doing the auto calibration sweep. If we also assume that the resync timing
# analysis give balanced setup and hold times, then the postamble timing path
# would be a simple case for static timing analysis.
# 
# In fact we don't know the resync phase during compilation, but we can find
# out the phase shift that will be applied to the resync clock after compilation
# has finished. Since we can work out what the data valid window at the resync
# registers will be relative to the DQS input pins, and we know that the
# sequencer will put the resync clock in the centre on this window, we can
# apply an offset to the default static timing analysis to account for the
# sequencer's behavior.
