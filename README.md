This is the implementation of the FPGA v4 for the Multi Purpose Digitizer (MPD)
used for GEM detector readout in the SBS setup at Jefferson Laboratory (USA).

Directory structure

.			Here can be run simulations with MODELSIM (see z_README.txt). TestBench.v is the simulation top level
|			DdrSdramIf_phy_alt_mem_phy_pll.mif is needed by ModelSim (copied from DdrSdramIf)
|
+---+-- Mpd_Common	Common Rtl Code for both devices, user generated and MegaWizard generated
    |
    +-- mpd_fiber	Aurora Interface (1 lane, 2.5 Gb/s) SSP compatible (in VHDL, written by Ben Raydo)
    |
    +-- Fir_Modules	FIR filters modules: 16 taps for MPD4, 12 taps for MPD3
    |
    +-- Mpd3		Top level RTL file  (Fpga_4.v), implementation specific verilog files (*Pll.v, RegisterBank.v)
    |	 |		and QUARTUS files for AGX50 implementation MPD rev 3.0
    |    |
    |    +- DdrSdramIf	Code for Ddr Sdram interface (generated by MegaWizard)
    |
    +-- Mpd4		Top level RTL files (Fpga_4.v), implementation specific verilog files (*Pll.v, RegisterBank.v)
    |    |		and QUARTUS files for AGX60 implementation MPD rev 4.0
    |    |
    |    |
    |    +- Ddr2SdramIf	Code for Ddr2 Sdram interface (generated by MegaWizard)
    |
    +-- Tdc		Trials for Trigger pulses TDC, final version moved to Mpd_Common. No more used
    |
    +-- Sort		Trial code to compute median value of serial incoming data. To be used in future.
